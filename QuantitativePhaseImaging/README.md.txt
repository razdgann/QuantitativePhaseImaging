# Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) in Python

This repository contains a Python class for simulating Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) techniques. QPI is a powerful tool used in optical imaging, particularly for studying transparent biological specimens like live cells.

## Features
- **Fresnel Propagation**: Simulates the propagation of an optical field.
- **Phase and Intensity Computation**: Extracts the phase and intensity from the propagated field.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use and extend for various QPI-related computations.

## Installation

To use this class, simply clone the repository and import the `QuantitativePhaseImaging` class into your Python project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantitativePhaseImaging.git
